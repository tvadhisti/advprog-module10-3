In the new version of the login page, I've made some changes to make it look better and easier to use. The background now shifts colors from blue to purple, giving it a fresh and modern feel. I also added a light, see-through white box around the form to make it stand out. The input area and button are now simpler and show clear changes when you interact with them, like clicking or typing. I changed the button text to just "Login" to make it clear what it does. These updates not only make the page nicer to look at but also make the code simpler and clearer.

I also made several changes to the chat page. The sidebar now has a gradient background shifting from blue to purple and the text color changed to white, giving it a more modern and engaging look. I added a vertical separator between the user sidebar and the chat area to better define these sections visually. The chat area also features the same gradient. Additionally, I modified the message display boxes to have a lighter background.

For the input field and send button in the chat area, I adjusted the styles to match the new theme, including a semi transparent background for the input field and a deeper violet color for the send button that changes on hover.
